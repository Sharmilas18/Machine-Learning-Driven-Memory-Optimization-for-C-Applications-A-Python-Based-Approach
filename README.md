# Machine-Learning-Driven-Memory-Optimization-for-C-Applications-A-Python-Based-Approach

In memory-intensive C++ applications, optimizing memory usage is critical, especially in environments with limited resources. This project introduces a Python-based approach that leverages runtime profiling data and machine learning (ML) techniques to enhance memory efficiency. The approach utilizes a **RandomForestRegressor** ML model to predict memory bottlenecks by analyzing complex interactions in profiling data. By identifying patterns in memory allocation, access, and release, the tool applies targeted optimizations such as replacing inefficient memory allocation calls, reallocation strategies, and ensuring proper deallocation of memory. The results demonstrate significant reductions in memory footprint and peak memory usage, providing valuable insights for developers aiming to improve memory-intensive applications.
